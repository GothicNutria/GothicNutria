Hello, I'm @GothicNutria! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a Spanish speaker, so Spanish is my native language.

I'm a passionate amateur programmer and high school student with experience in the following languages: C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Lua, Python. Although I have experience
in various languages, I focus more on some than others, so my proficiency level varies depending on the language. The languages I handle best are C#, JavaScript, PHP, and Python.

I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JQuery technologies.

Most of the time, I program for both fun and passion, and I've been self-learning for 4 years. However, I've been studying programming in high school for the last two years.
