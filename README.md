Hello, I'm @GothicNutria! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I am a Spanish speaker, so Spanish is my native language.

I am a passionate amateur programmer, I am 17 years old and I live in Latin America, I study programming in my high school, I have developed logic for four years. Although I have experience
in various languages, I focus more on some than others, so my proficiency level varies depending on the language.

<h2>About Me</h2>

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning SQL.

ðŸ’¼ I'm a programming student in my final year of high school.

ðŸŽ“ I have experience in process automation using C#, JavaScript, PHP with HTML or simply PHP, and Python.
